 # Python Utility Functions
Welcome to Python Utility Functions, your go-to repository for various Python functions and class implementations!


## Instructions
For this project, you'll be implementing a series of Python functions and a class that demonstrate essential programming concepts and operations.
 
 ## Topics tested in this Code Challenge:
 
 Implementing functions to handle basic operations, string manipulation, and mathematical calculations.

 Understanding and applying decorators.

Working with lists, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming in Python.


  ## Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

Add Numbers: Create a function named add_numbers to return the sum of two numbers.


Reverse a String: Write a function named reverse_string to reverse a given string.


Count Vowels: Develop a function named count_vowels to count the number of vowels in a string.


Calculate Factorial: Define a function named calculate_factorial to compute the factorial of a non-negative integer.


Apply a Decorator: Create a function named apply_decorator to apply a decorator that prints "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.


Sort Tuples: Write a function named sort_by_age to sort a list of tuples by age in ascending order.


Merge Dictionaries: Implement a function named merge_dicts to merge two dictionaries and sum the values of common keys.


Class Creation: Define a class named Car with attributes make, model, and year, and include a method named display_info to print the car's details.


##  System Requirements
Python 3.8+


A text editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text, etc.)


A browser for viewing documentation (optional)


Operating System (Windows 10+, MacOS, Linux, etc.)


RAM >= 4GB


Disk space >= 1GB

## Installation

 ### Alternative One
1.Open your terminal or command line interface.


2.Clone the repository by running the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/keelann95/Toy-Problems
3. Change directory to the repo folder:

        cd Toy-Problems
4. Open the project in your preferred code editor. If using VS Code, you can use the command:

        code .

  ### Alternative Two
1. On the top right corner of this page, click the "Fork" button.

2. Create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

3. Follow the process described in Alternative One to clone your forked repository. Remember to replace yourusername with your GitHub username:

        git clone https://github.com/keelann95/Toy-Problems

  ## Running the Python Code

Open the integrated terminal in your code editor or command line.


Run the Python scripts directly or use the interactive Python interpreter to test the functions and class implementations.


For individual function testing, you can create a script like test_functions.py and run it with:


        python test_functions.py
